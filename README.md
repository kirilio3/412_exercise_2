# Duckiebot ROS Assignment

This repository contains the code and documentation for the ROS-based Duckiebot assignment. We familiarized ourself with ROS and duckiebot functionalities and implemented various functions including odometry using wheel encoders, rotating the robot, and making the Duckiebot follow a specific path while utilizing ROS services and visual feedback via LED lights.

## Part I: Getting Comfortable with ROS

### 1. ROS Wiki Concepts:

Nodes, Topics, Services, Messages, and Bags were explored and explained in detail.
Communication setup between nodes was established and tested.

### 2. Using ROS with Duckiebots:
We set up DTROS and created a catkin package.
Implemented the first ROS publisher and subscriber to communicate between nodes.

### 3. Basic Operations with Camera:
Created a subscriber for the camera feed.
Processed the image: converted to grayscale, annotated with robot's hostname and image size.
`camera_processing_node.py`
Published the annotated image on a custom topic.
Used rqt_image_view to visualize the image and included a screenshot.

## Part II: Odometry Using Wheel Encoders

### 1. Wheel Encoder Data:

Subscribed to data from wheel encoders and published it for control.

### 2. Straight Line Task:

Successfully moved the Duckiebot forward and backward by 1.25 meters, measured deviations from desired location.
`straight_line_task.py`
Answered questions about speed and deviations.

### 3. Rotation Task:

Rotated the Duckiebot 90 degrees clockwise and then back to 0 degrees counterclockwise.
`rotate_node.py`
Observed and analyzed deviations, discussed possible causes.

### 4. Bag File Creation:
Saved the odometry data from both straight line and rotation task to a `csc22911_rotate_odometry.bag` and `csc22911_straight_line_odometry.bag`.

Loaded the rosbag in a Python script `compute_trajectory.py` for straight line and `compute_trajectory_rotate.py`, then plotted individual trajectories to visualize the movement of the Duckiebot. They both can be run from VSCode.

## Part III: Playing with Duckiebots

### 1. LED Light Feedback:
Implemented a ROS service in `led_control_node.py` to change the LED light color based on the Duckiebot's state (e.g., blue for one state, green for another).
Documented the state-to-color mapping. You can run it to test through 
`rosservice call /set_led_state "data: true"`, `rosservice call /set_led_state "data: false"`. However, the code was utilized properly in ourn D-shape follow execution. 

### 2. Multiple ROS Nodes:
Implemented two ROS nodes: one for task execution and one for controlling the LED lights `D_Shape_Node.py` and `led_control_node.py`.
Hopefully our termination of nodes after task completion is proper.

### 3. Path Following:
Kept the Duckiebot stationary for 5 seconds with the LED in one color.
Moved the Duckiebot along a D-shaped path: a straight segment and a semi-circular segment, with the LED light color updated.
Couldn't however get the robot to ideally return to the start position.

### We didn't have enough time to complete tasks 4 and 5 of part III. Our robot died. 

## Conclusion
By completing this assignment, we gained hands-on experience with ROS communication, task automation, and data analysis using ROS bags.
